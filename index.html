      <p>
        The Development of Specializations Recommendation System for College of Computer Studies of LSPU - SPCC is a project aimed
        at creating a centralized and automated platform for specialization recommendations for students. The system will consist of
        an evaluation exam that assesses the students' abilities, preferences, and career aspirations. The exam questions are 
        validated by a licensed psychometrician to ensure that they are reliable and accurate. Based on the exam results and 
        students' preferences, the system will generate a list of recommended specializations that align with their strengths and 
        interests. The project aims to provide a reliable and accurate assessment tool, reduce the burden on faculty and administration, 
        and gather data on students' preferences, interests, and strengths to improve the quality of education provided by the college.
